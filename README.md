# Final Project of Dvelopers Institute Data Analytics Bootcamp

### Data Source  
https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/city-of-new-york/nyc-citi-bike

### Data Description 
The dataset includes data on 58,937,715 trips since 2013.

### Scope
SQL(BigQuery), Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Tableau

### Goals
1. Develop a machine learning model to predict subscriber churn based on usage patterns, trip frequency, demographics, and other relevant factors. This model helps identify subscribers who are likely to stop using the service, allowing the company to proactively engage with them through personalized offers, incentives, or service improvements to retain them.
2. Build a time series forecasting model to predict the demand for bikes at specific stations at different times of the day. Accurate demand forecasting enables efficient station management, ensuring bikes are available where theyâ€™re needed most and reducing operational costs associated with imbalances in bike distribution.

### Business Benefits
- Improved subscriber retention: Predicting churn allows the company to engage at-risk subscribers with targeted retention strategies, increasing customer loyalty and reducing turnover.
- Operational efficiency: Reliable demand forecasts help optimize resource allocation, ensuring stations are neither over- nor under-supplied, leading to more efficient bike distribution.
- Cost reduction: By proactively managing subscriber churn and forecasting demand, the company can reduce costs related to customer acquisition and bike redistribution while maintaining service quality.
- Strategic decision-making: Churn prediction insights allow for more effective marketing campaigns and customer engagement, while station demand forecasts inform resource planning and station expansion strategies.
