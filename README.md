### Data Description 
The dataset includes data on 58,937,715 trips since 2013.

### Scope
SQL(BigQuery), Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Tableau

### Goals
1. Build a reliable model to predict trip duration based on factors like station distance, day of the week, and time of day. 
2.  Identify key factors influencing the number of trips, such as weather conditions and peak usage times
3.  Leverage data insights to enhance station management, resource allocation, and overall service efficiency.

### Business Benefits
- Operational efficiency: The model helps optimize bike station locations by understanding how station distance impacts trip duration, improving resource allocation.
- Demand forecasting: Predicting the number of trips based on factors like weather and time of day enables better fleet management and service planning.
- Enhanced customer experience: Insights into trip patterns allow for tailored services, improving user satisfaction and retention by aligning availability with peak demand times.
